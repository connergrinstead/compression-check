# Compression Check

This script was developed with the intent to visualize and analyze the compression levels observed on multiple cylinders.

It may be run on a Raspberry Pi with Adafruit_ADS1x15 Analog to Digital converters reading from pressure sensors.

As a proof of concept, the current script can also be run with the appropriate "Adafruit_ADS1x15_EMULATOR.py", in order to emulate the values otherwise read from physical sensors.

The following image shows the tool ran on a four cylinder engine:
